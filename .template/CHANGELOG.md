# Template changelog

## 0.1.1 (2026-09-27)
Fixed the first-run CI failure: a job-level `hashFiles()` condition is invalid on GitHub
Actions and was moved inside the step. Switched gitleaks in CI from a Docker container to
a downloaded binary (the container tripped git's "dubious ownership" check on runners).
Fixed the Dockerfile so `uv run` doesn't try to write to the root-owned venv as a non-root
user (venv's `bin` added to `PATH`, entrypoint runs `python` directly). Grouped Dependabot
updates (uv, GitHub Actions). Updated pre-commit hook versions. Added `.template/GUIDE.md`,
linked from both READMEs.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-27)
Initial version, distilled from a real project: docs-as-code state, decision records,
workstreams, advisor role, secrets-first setup, Python/uv/Docker, CI with gitleaks,
pluggable deploy targets (Fly, AWS; GCP stub), Claude Code session commands.
